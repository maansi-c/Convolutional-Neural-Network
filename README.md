This project is a compilation of my Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing skills that I enhanced over winter break. 

The data contains hundreds of restaurant reviews and then 1 or 0 beside it, respectively indicating whether the review was positive or negative. 

I preprocessed the data to highlight key words in each review. Then I built multiple different classification models to experiment with the data to decide which model worked the best. 

In the end, I observed that the Support Vector Machine model worked the best on this data.
